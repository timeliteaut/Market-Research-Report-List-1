<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Semi-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic Electronic Brake System refers to a system that changes the brake force automatically based on various factors such as speed, road conditions, and driver input. This type of system requires no manual intervention from the driver. On the other hand, a Semi-automatic Electronic Brake System allows the driver to manually adjust the brake force to some extent, while still having some level of automation. Both types aim to improve vehicle safety and braking efficiency, but offer different levels of control to the driver.</p></p>
