<p><h1>Self-expanding Coronary Stents Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Key Geographical Regions, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Self-expanding Coronary Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Self-expanding coronary stents are small, metal mesh tubes inserted into narrowed or blocked coronary arteries during an angioplasty procedure to restore blood flow. Unlike balloon-expandable stents which rely on balloon inflation, self-expanding stents have a built-in spring-like mechanism that allows them to expand on their own and conform to the shape and size of the blood vessel. This makes them more flexible, less prone to complications, and suitable for treating complex lesions.</p><p>The self-expanding coronary stents market is expected to witness substantial growth in the coming years. Factors driving market growth include the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, increasing geriatric population, and technological advancements in interventional cardiology. Additionally, the growing adoption of minimally invasive procedures and the surge in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are further propelling market expansion.</p><p>Moreover, the market is also witnessing several trends that are shaping its growth trajectory. For instance, the development of bioresorbable stents that gradually dissolve over time is gaining prominence. Bioresorbable stents eliminate the long-term effects of permanent implants and enable natural vessel healing. Furthermore, the integration of drug-eluting technology with self-expanding stents is another trend that is contributing to market growth. Drug-eluting stents help prevent restenosis by releasing drugs that inhibit the growth of scar tissue.</p><p>In conclusion, the self-expanding coronary stents market is projected to experience significant growth over the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, advancements in interventional cardiology, and the emergence of innovative technologies are key factors driving this market expansion. The integration of drug-eluting technology and the development of bioresorbable stents are important trends shaping the market's growth trajectory. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% during the forecast period.</p></p>
