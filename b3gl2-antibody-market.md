<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The B3GL2 Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>pAbs</li><li>mAb</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The B3GL2 Antibody market includes different types of antibodies, namely polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Polyclonal antibodies are produced by injecting an antigen into animals, and the serum containing a mixture of antibodies is collected. These antibodies have a wide range of binding activity but lack specificity. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single clone of cells and offer high specificity and binding affinity towards a specific antigen. Both pAbs and mAbs cater to the demand for B3GL2 antibodies but have different characteristics and applications in the market.</p></p>
