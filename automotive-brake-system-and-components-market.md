<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake System and Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc Brake</li><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake system and components market can be classified into three main types: disc brake, drum brake, and others. Disc brakes use calipers to squeeze brake pads against a rotor to slow down the vehicle, offering better performance and heat dissipation. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes to press against the drum to create friction and stop the vehicle. The "others" category typically includes parking brakes, regenerative braking systems, and anti-lock braking systems (ABS).</p></p>
