<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organ Preservation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Cold Storage</li><li>Hypothermic Machine Perfusion</li><li>Normothermic Machine Perfusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The organ preservation market includes three main types: static cold storage, hypothermic machine perfusion, and normothermic machine perfusion. Static cold storage involves preserving organs by immersing them in a cold, preservation solution. Hypothermic machine perfusion maintains the organs at a low temperature and perfuses them with a cold solution to reduce injury. Normothermic machine perfusion keeps organs at normal body temperature and perfuses them with warm, oxygenated blood to maintain organ function. These different techniques aim to extend the lifespan of organs before transplantation and improve their viability.</p></p>
