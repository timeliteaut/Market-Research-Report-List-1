<p><strong>The Nipradilol Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glaucoma</li><li>Ocular Hypertension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nipradilol is a medication used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension by reducing intraocular pressure in the eyes. Glaucoma is a condition characterized by damage to the optic nerve, often caused by increased pressure in the eye.
