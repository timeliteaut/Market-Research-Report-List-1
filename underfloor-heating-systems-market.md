<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underfloor Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Heating</li><li>Electric Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Underfloor heating systems have two main types: gas heating and electric heating. Gas heating systems use a network of pipes installed beneath the floor to circulate hot water. This water is heated using gas as the fuel source, providing efficient and cost-effective heating. On the other hand, electric heating systems use electric cables or mats embedded in the floor to generate heat. These systems are easy to install and allow for individual room control, but they tend to be more expensive to operate compared to gas heating systems.</p></p>
