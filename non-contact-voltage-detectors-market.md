<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-contact Voltage Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive</li><li>Magnetic Induction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact voltage detectors are available in two main types - capacitive and magnetic induction. Capacitive voltage detectors work by detecting changes in the electric field generated by an energized object, while magnetic induction detectors identify changes in the magnetic field. Capacitive detectors are more sensitive to low voltage levels and are suitable for detecting live wires in walls, while magnetic induction detectors are better for detecting high voltage levels in electrical equipment. Both types provide a safe and efficient way to detect voltage without direct contact.</p></p>
