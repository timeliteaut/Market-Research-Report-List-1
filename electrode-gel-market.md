<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrode Gel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halide-Containing Gel</li><li>Non-Halide Gel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrode gel market is divided into two main types based on the presence of halides: halide-containing gel and non-halide gel. Halide-containing gel typically contains substances like chloride ions, which can improve electrode conductivity but may also cause skin irritation in some individuals. Non-halide gel, on the other hand, is formulated without these potentially irritating substances, making it a safer option for sensitive skin. Both types of gel are commonly used in medical procedures, physical therapy, and other applications requiring electrode conductivity.</p></p>
