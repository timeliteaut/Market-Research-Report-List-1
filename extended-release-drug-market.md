<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extended Release Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sustained Release Drug</li><li>Controlled Release Drug</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extended release drugs are designed to release the active ingredients slowly over an extended period of time, maintaining a steady concentration of the drug in the bloodstream. There are two main types of extended release drugs: sustained release and controlled release. Sustained release drugs release the medication gradually and continuously, ensuring a steady level of drug concentration. Controlled release drugs, on the other hand, release the medication according to a predetermined pattern, providing a specific release rate to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Both types aim to optimize drug efficacy and reduce the frequency of dosing.</p></p>
