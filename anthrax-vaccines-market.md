<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anthrax Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Live Vaccines</li><li>Cell free PA Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anthrax vaccines can be classified into two main types: live vaccines and cell-free PA vaccines. Live vaccines contain weakened or attenuated forms of the anthrax bacteria, which stimulate the immune system's response without causing illness. On the other hand, cell-free PA vaccines are made by extracting a specific protein called protective antigen (PA) from the anthrax bacteria and using it to develop immunity. Both types of vaccines aim to provide protection against anthrax infection but employ different approaches to stimulate the immune system.</p></p>
