<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Sensor</li><li>Passive Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active sensor in the automotive airbag sensor market refers to sensors that actively monitor various parameters such as acceleration, pressure, and occupant presence in real-time to trigger the deployment of airbags. These sensors are constantly collecting data and making decisions to ensure the safety of occupants during a crash. On the other hand, passive sensors are triggered by a certain threshold of force or impact, without actively monitoring the vehicle conditions. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of airbag deployment in different scenarios.</p></p>
