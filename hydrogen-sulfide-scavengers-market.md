<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Sulfide Scavengers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regenerative</li><li>Non-Regenerative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogen sulfide scavengers are chemicals used to remove hydrogen sulfide gas from various industrial processes. There are two main types of hydrogen sulfide scavengers on the market: regenerative and non-regenerative. </p><p>Regenerative scavengers can be reused multiple times as they are able to regenerate themselves after reacting with hydrogen sulfide. On the other hand, non-regenerative scavengers are one-time use chemicals that must be disposed of after use. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on specific needs and preferences of the users.</p></p>
