<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermopile Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Channel Detector</li><li>Multi Channel Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermopile detectors come in two main types: single channel detectors and multi channel detectors. Single channel detectors consist of a single thermopile sensor that measures the intensity of infrared radiation. On the other hand, multi channel detectors have multiple thermopile sensors arranged in an array to detect radiation across different wavelengths or angles. Single channel detectors are ideal for simple applications, while multi channel detectors are more versatile and suitable for complex and advanced detection needs.</p></p>
