<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Slimicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Oxidising Type</li><li>Oxidising Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Slimicides are chemicals used to control the growth of bacteria, fungi, and algae in various industrial applications. Non-oxidising slimicides work by disrupting cellular processes in microorganisms, while oxidising slimicides release oxygen, chlorine, or other oxidising agents to kill microbes. Non-oxidising slimicides are often preferred for sensitive applications where oxidising agents may cause damage. Oxidising slimicides are more powerful and fast-acting, making them suitable for heavy microbial contamination. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining hygiene and safety in industrial environments.</p></p>
