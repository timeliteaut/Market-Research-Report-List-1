<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Invasive and Non-Invasive Type Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The invasive type neonatal ventilator refers to a medical device that requires the insertion of a breathing tube into the baby's airway, usually through their nose or mouth. This type of ventilation is typically used for newborns with severe respiratory distress or other serious lung conditions. On the other hand, the non-invasive type neonatal ventilator does not require the insertion of a breathing tube. Instead, it provides respiratory support to the baby via a mask or nasal prongs, making it a less invasive option for babies who can still breathe on their own to some extent.</p></p>
