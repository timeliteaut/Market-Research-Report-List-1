<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PH Probes Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Refillable</li><li>Refillable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PH probe electrodes are widely used in various industries for measuring the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. There are two main types of PH probe electrodes: non-refillable and refillable. Non-refillable electrodes are disposable and need to be replaced once the electrolyte runs out. Refillable electrodes, on the other hand, can be refilled with electrolyte when needed, making them more cost-effective in the long run. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the user.</p></p>
